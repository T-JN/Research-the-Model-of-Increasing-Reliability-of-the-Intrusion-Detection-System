# Research-the-Model-of-Increasing-Reliability-of-the-Intrusion-Detection-System
The paper presents the results of results on the use of a recurrent neural network to detect malicious software as part of the Snort intrusion detection system.
The research was conducted on datasets generated on the basis of malware athena, dyre, engrat, grum, mimikatz, surtr source code: With exploitation of the vulnerability in CVE-2022-20685 in the Snort intrusion detection system. Processing of input traffic data was carried out before the frag3 and modbus preprocessors. The method of k nearest neighbors was used as a mathematical apparatus. The simulation of the developed software at different iterations and visualization of the results was carried out
